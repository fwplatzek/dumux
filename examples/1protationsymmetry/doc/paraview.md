# Post-processing with ParaView

The result file `example_rotationsymmetry.pvd` can be opened with the software [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/).
To obtain a visualisation as shown in the introduction of this documented example, after loading
the result file, choose `Filters`>`Alphabetical`>`Rotational Extrusion`.
You might have to reset your view and switch to `3D`. Then apply `Filters`>`Alphabetical`>`Warp By Scalar`.
